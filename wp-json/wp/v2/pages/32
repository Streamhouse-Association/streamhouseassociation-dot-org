BOARD RESPONSIBILITIES <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The general duties for directors are to enforce the association\u2019s governing documents, collect and preserve the association\u2019s financial resources, insure&nbsp;the association\u2019s assets against loss, and keep the common areas in a state of good repair. To fulfill that responsibility, directors must:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7 regularly attend board meetings,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7 review material provided in preparation for board meetings,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7 review the association\u2019s financial reports, and<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7 make reasonable inquiry before making decisions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>B. PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, directors and committee members must conduct all dealings with vendors and employees with honesty and fairness, and safeguard information that belongs to the association.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-Dealing.<\/strong> Self-dealing occurs when directors or committee members make decisions that materially benefit themselves or their relatives at the expense of the association. \u201cRelatives\u201d include a person\u2019s spouse, parents, siblings, children, mothers and fathers-in-law, sons and daughters-in-law, brothers and sisters-in-law and anyone who shares the person\u2019s residence. Benefits include money, privileges, special benefits, gifts or other item of value. Accordingly, no director or committee member may:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7 solicit or receive any compensation from the association for serving on the board or any committee,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7 make promises to vendors unless with prior approval from the board,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7 solicit or receive, any gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan, or any other thing of value for themselves or their relatives from a person or company who is seeking a business or financial relationship with the association,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7 seek preferential treatment for themselves or their relatives,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7 use association property, services, equipment or business for the gain or benefit of themselves or their relatives, except as is provided for all members of the association.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Confidential Information.<\/strong> Directors and committee members are responsible for protecting the association\u2019s confidential information. As such they may not use confidential information for the benefit of themselves or their relatives. Except when disclosure is duly authorized or legally mandated, no director or committee member may disclose confidential information. Confidential information includes, without limitation:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7 private personal information of fellow directors and committee members,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7 private personnel information of the association\u2019s employees,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7 disciplinary actions against members of the association,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7 assessment collection information against members of the association, and<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7 legal disputes in which the association is or may be involved&#8211;directors may not discuss such matters with persons not on the board without the prior approval of the association\u2019s legal counsel. Failure to follow these restrictions could constitute a breach of the attorney-client privilege and loss of confidential information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; Misrepresentation.<\/strong> Directors and committee members may not knowingly misrepresent facts. All association data, records and reports must be accurate and truthful and prepared in a proper manner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interaction with Employees.<\/strong> To ensure efficient management operations, avoid conflicting instructions from the board to management and avoid potential liability, committee members and directors shall observe the following guidelines:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7 The president of the board shall serve as liaison between the board and management and provide board or committee approved direction on day to day matters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7 If directors or committee members are contacted by employees with complaints, the employees shall be instructed to contact management or the board as a whole.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7 No director may threaten or retaliate against an employee who brings information to the board regarding improper actions of a director or committee member.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7 Directors and committee members are prohibited from harassing or threatening employees, vendors, directors, committee members, and owners, whether verbally, physically or otherwise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proper Decorum.<\/strong> Directors and committee members are obligated to act with proper decorum. Although they may disagree with the opinions of others on the board or committee, they must act with respect and dignity and not make personal attacks on others. Accordingly, directors and committee members must focus on issues, not personalities and conduct themselves with courtesy toward each other and toward employees, managing agents, vendors and members of the association. Directors shall act in accordance with board decisions and shall not act unilaterally or contrary to the board\u2019s decisions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>C. WHEN CONFLICTS OF INTEREST ARISE<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Situations may arise that are not expressly covered by this policy or where the proper course of action is unclear. Directors and committee members should immediately raise such situations with the board.

Directors and committee members must withdraw from participation in decisions in which they have a material interest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Violations of Policy.<\/strong> Directors and committee members who violate the association\u2019s ethic\u2019s policy are deemed to be acting outside the course and scope of their authority. Anyone in violation of this policy may be subject to immediate disciplinary action, including, but not limited to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7 censure,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7 removal from committees,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7 removal as an officer of the board,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7 request for resignation from the board,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7 recall by the membership, and<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b7 legal proceedings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to taking any of the actions described above, the board shall appoint an executive committee to investigate the violation. The committee shall review the evidence of violation, endeavor to meet with the director\/committee member believed to be in violation, confer with the association\u2019s legal counsel, and present its findings and recommendations to the board for appropriate action. The board shall endeavor to meet with the director\/committee member in executive session prior to imposing disciplinary action against that person.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>D.
